So this is a part of the Udacity course UIKit Fundamentals.
It is only supposed to be a simple app that teaches you different ways to use segues.
I got totally carried away and abstracted out the 'brain' of the app into a separate class.
There are a few methods that I'm not entirely happy with, but for the most part it is pretty clean.
I got some really good practice with conditional statements, boolean logic and switch statements.

I also learned that outlets are not set initially in a new view.
You have to put them in a 'holding bay' of sorts in the new ViewControllerClass as variables.
Then you can take the values stored in the variables and assign them to any outlets in a setup method like ViewDidLoad.
